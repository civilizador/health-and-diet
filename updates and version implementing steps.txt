Adding authentication support

//  1. Create 2 new files: login.ejs register.ejs in views dir
//  2. Install passport, passport-local, passport-local-mongoose, express-session 
//  3. Create login and logout routes
//  4. Pass req.user value to NEW route so we can add ticket owner field 
//  5. Add a function "isLoggedIn" in app.js(end of the file) which wiilll check if user was logged in
        // to do so we just add isLoggedIn() into the any route we want to perform this check
